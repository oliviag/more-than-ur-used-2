<p>I used to just get left places. Baseball fields, swimming pools, movie theaters, the side of a highway. During a family vacation, we were leaving a rest stop and when everyone packed themselves back into the car they mustve not noticed I was still inside the bathroom. I watched our woodie station wagon roll out of the gravel parking lot and drive down the road, thinking it was a practical joke, one that tended to happen often and always seemingly by accident. So i just waited there on the side of the road, begrudgingly expecting a big laugh from my 5 other siblings when I got back into the car. It was a long prank, about 45 minutes, or so it seemed in my mind. I was young, don’t forget, and at that point I was starting to get scared. When the car finally came back around, my family looked like a bunch of startled deer and my mother was in tears. She said everyone just figured I was reading in the back and why didn’t I speak up, why didn’t I make my presence known? Even though I was 5 I somehow understood that I wasn’t meant to answer that question.
