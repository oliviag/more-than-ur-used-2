After I put down these huge spools of material he came up to me with a wad of cash, 20 messy bills in a variety of fives and ones and just jammed it into the front pocket of my the work-appropriate skinny jeans I’d worn countless times before. He told me, “Thanks for your heavy-lifting today, go treat yourself to a manicure,” and that was it. In the following weeks, I lay awake at night fighting with myself as to why this incident bothered me the way it did, but there was really no clear solution. Night after night I’d wrestle with my feelings about it, but ‘d always leave them in a hopeless entanglement by the morning. The team consisted of men he’d worked with for the last 20 years, family friends of my boss at this point, and men who I’d proved myself to in my 6 years of employment there. After that incident, my sense of place there was so disrupted I felt like I could no longer do my job properly. In the weeks following I started leaving work early because of the skin-crawling sensation I’d feel every time he walked by my cubicle. The feeling became so unbearable that I put in my 2 weeks with no immediate employment prospects to fall back on.</p>
